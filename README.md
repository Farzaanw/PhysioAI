# LectureLife

> **Turn any lecture into a live, AI-powered interactive experience — in real time.**

Traditional lecture attendance is declining — research shows that students retain significantly less information from passive lecture formats compared to active learning approaches (Freeman et al., 2014)¹. Students do not engage with static slides, teachers struggle to assess understanding in real time, and lecture recordings are rarely watched (Burchfield & Sappington, 2000)². LectureLife fixes this — teachers upload a PDF, go live instantly, and an AI agent pipeline transforms every slide into quizzes, summaries, and interactive content while students follow along on any device.

---

## Features

- **Real-time slide sync** — Students join via QR code and see slides in perfect sync. No app download required.
- **Live Q&A** — Students type questions that appear as animated notifications on the teacher's screen, queued in the sidebar for verbal response.
- **AI Slide Enhancement** — A two-agent Mastra pipeline extracts key concepts and generates quizzes, walkthroughs, flip cards, and study guides on the fly.
- **Teacher Dashboard** — Upload PDF, present, and monitor student questions live.
- **Works on any device** — Accessible via public tunnel from any phone, tablet, or laptop.
- **Zero friction** — Teachers upload a PDF. No content creation overhead.

## How It Works

1. **Teacher uploads a PDF** — slides are rendered client-side using PDF.js and converted to images.
2. **Teacher clicks "Present to Class"** — slides sync to the server; a QR code with the public student link appears in the sidebar.
3. **Students scan or open the link** — they see the current slide in real time, always in sync with the teacher.
4. **Students submit questions** — typed into an input bar at the bottom of their screen; questions appear as animated notifications on the teacher's display and are queued in the sidebar for verbal response.
5. **Teacher clicks "Enhance" on any slide** — the two-agent Mastra pipeline runs: Agent 1 extracts a structured knowledge graph, Agent 2 generates an interactive component with optional PPTX export.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (AgentWorkflow), Node.js 20+ (server)
- ngrok account (free tier sufficient)
- Anthropic API key

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Farzaanw/PhysioAI
cd PhysioAI
```

### 2. Set up the environment file

> ⚠️ **Required:** Create a `.env` file inside the `AgentWorkflow/` folder before starting the agent workflow. Without this file, the AI pipeline will not function.

```bash
cd AgentWorkflow
cat > .env << EOF
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com
EOF
```

### 3. Quick Start — Single Command (Recommended)

The easiest way to run all four services at once is with the included `start.sh` script in the project root:

```bash
# Make it executable (first time only)
chmod +x start.sh

# Start everything
./start.sh
```

This launches all four services in the background in the correct order:
1. **Server** (`localhost:3001`) — Express + Socket.io backend
2. **Agent Workflow** (`localhost:3333`) — Mastra AI pipeline
3. **ngrok** — Public tunnel at `https://lining-quintet-flock.ngrok-free.dev`
4. **Frontend** (`localhost:5173`) — React teacher app

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop all services cleanly.

### 4. Manual Start — Four Separate Terminals

If you prefer to run each service in its own terminal for easier debugging:

**Terminal 1 — Server:**
```bash
cd server && NGROK_URL=https://lining-quintet-flock.ngrok-free.dev node index.js
```

**Terminal 2 — ngrok:**
```bash
ngrok http --url=lining-quintet-flock.ngrok-free.dev 3001
```

**Terminal 3 — Agent Workflow:**
```bash
cd AgentWorkflow && npx tsx src/api/server.ts
```

**Terminal 4 — Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

### 5. Access the application

| Role | URL |
|---|---|
| Teacher | http://localhost:5173 |
| Student | https://lining-quintet-flock.ngrok-free.dev/student |

## Known Limitations and Roadmap

### Current Limitations

| Limitation | Detail |
|---|---|
| ngrok dependency | Public student access requires a running ngrok tunnel. The URL changes every session on the free tier. |
| In-memory session state | Slides and questions are stored in memory — restarting the server clears the active session. |
| Single classroom | One active presentation session at a time. Multi-room support is not yet implemented. |
| Node.js version split | AgentWorkflow requires Node.js >= 22.13 while the server runs on 20.x, requiring two separate runtimes. |
| No authentication | Anyone with the ngrok URL can access the student view. No access control is implemented. |

### Roadmap

- **Persistent deployment** — migrate from ngrok to Railway or Render for a stable public URL with persistent session storage
- **Multi-room support** — unique room codes per session so multiple teachers can present simultaneously
- **Student identity** — optional name entry so the teacher knows who submitted each question
- **Question upvoting** — students surface the most important questions collectively
- **Confusion meter** — a live signal showing the teacher what percentage of students are struggling with the current slide
- **Post-session export** — generate a PDF summary of all questions, slides covered, and AI-generated study notes
- **AI question clustering** — group semantically similar questions into a single summary to reduce teacher sidebar noise

## Challenges

### QR Code Encoding Localhost

The most significant time investment of the build. The QR code was encoding `http://localhost:3001/student`, which works on the teacher's machine and nowhere else. A student's phone scanning that URL looks for a server on the phone itself, finds nothing, and renders a black screen.

The fix required three changes: binding the server to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`; fetching the machine's real LAN IP via a `/info` endpoint rather than hardcoding localhost in the React app; and unblocking Node.js in macOS firewall settings, which was silently dropping incoming connections from other devices on the same network. We ultimately bypassed all of this with ngrok, which tunnels the local server through a stable HTTPS URL accessible from any device on any network.

### Socket.io Requests Intercepted by ngrok

After resolving the URL issue, the student page still showed a perpetual connecting state on mobile. ngrok intercepts unrecognized HTTP clients and serves a browser warning interstitial page. Socket.io's polling transport was receiving that warning page instead of a valid server response, causing silent connection failure.

The fix was adding `extraHeaders: { 'ngrok-skip-browser-warning': 'true' }` to the socket.io client configuration, which instructs ngrok to bypass the interstitial and pass requests directly to the server.

### Slide Images Over WebSocket

The initial architecture pushed the entire slide deck — base64-encoded PNG images — through a single `upload-slides` WebSocket event. On a local network this was functional. Over ngrok on mobile, the payload was too large and timed out silently, leaving the student view empty with no error.

The solution was a clear separation of concerns: WebSocket events carry only lightweight metadata (slide count, current index), while slide images are served as standard HTTP responses at `/slide/:index`. The student page fetches each image with a standard `img` element, which is what HTTP was designed for.

### Mastra API Configuration with Custom Base URL

The AgentWorkflow uses `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, which reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment but does not respect `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` by default. Every agent call was hitting the wrong endpoint and returning authentication errors despite a valid key being present.

The resolution was replacing the default `anthropic` import with `createAnthropic({ apiKey, baseURL })`, which explicitly passes both values at instantiation time rather than relying on environment variable auto-detection.
